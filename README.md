# gepstein
A site to use as a sort of resume, to fill with examples of my work as I learn.

This site can be viewed at gepstein.com
***I'm not a web designer, as is immediately apparent!***
The site is to show that I can build, I can bug-fix, I can deploy... etc.
There are, at the time of writing, sections built using only HTML, CSS & Bootstrap, others that add in Javascript and JQuery, and some that build in AngularJS.  I'm learning as I go so this is very much practice, just as is using git and github.

Much of the work in the example pages comes from the codecademy lessons and instructions. They outlined what had to be built and I built it, according to requirements, rather than instructions (they didn't tell me how to code, only what to code).

I plan to move on to Ruby and Rails soon and from there who knows. Practice makes perfect!
